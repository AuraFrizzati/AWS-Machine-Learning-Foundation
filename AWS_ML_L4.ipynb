If you have broken up your code into an unnecessary amount of functions and modules, you'll have to jump around everywhere if you want to view the implementation details for something that may be too small to be worth it. Creating more modules doesn't necessarily result in effective modularization.\n",

        "  - Create and switch to a new branch called demographic from the develop branch: `git checkout -b demographic`\n",

        "    - `git commit -m 'added location specific recommendations'`\n",
        "    - `...`\n",
        "- **Step 3**: However, in the middle of your work, you need to work on another feature. So you commit your changes on this demographic branch, and switch back to the develop branch:\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Step 5:** After you finish your work on the `friend_groups` branch, you commit your changes, switch back to the development branch, merge it back to the develop branch, and push this to the remote repository’s develop branch.\n",
        "  - Commit your changes before switching: `git commit -m 'finalized friend_groups recommendations '`\n",
        "  - Switch to the develop branch: `git checkout develop`\n",

Git wouldn’t know whether to delete the line or modify it. You need to tell Git which change to take, and some tools even allow you to edit the change manually. If it isn’t straightforward, you may have to consult with the developer of the other branch to handle a merge conflict.\n",
